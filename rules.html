            Goal of the game
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            London Manhunt is a game where a team of "runners" must hide from an ever-growing team of "hunters" for a
            certain time period, all whilst having trackers following their every move.
            <br>
            To win the game, you must be able to flee from the hunters for 4 hours.

            Setup
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
           Before and after every game, you must meet up outside the London King's Cross Tube Station Entrance.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
           A hunter should be selected at the start of every game, who's goal it will be to chase down every other person, who will all be runners.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            Every person playing should install Google Maps tracking, and share an access link for 24 hours with every other member.
            It is advised that a Snapchat/Discord group is also created for the hunters and everyone playing.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            After everything is set up, the runners have 15 minutes to travel between zones 1-3 before the clock begins and the hunter is allowed to start
            chasing them.

            How to play as a hunter
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            To play as a hunter, you must try and "tag" as many runners as possible, before the 4 hours is up.
            Hunters should work as a team to assure this is achieved. Once a runner is tagged, they are now
            a hunter.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
          Hunters have <strong>no restrictions</strong> on what modes of transit they may use, and may enter/exit any
          London Fare zones, provided they don't leave Greater London.

            How to play as a runner
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            To play as a runner, you must avoid being "tagged" by the hunters for 4 hours. This can be achieved through
            utilising public transit.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            Runners may use any TfL-managed service, as well as walking/running to get around, however there are some restrictions.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            Firstly, runners <strong>must not leave London Zones 1-3, including the Tram Fare Zone, </strong> even if
            only for a short while. This goes down to London Zones 1-2 in the third hour, and only Zone 1 in the last hour.
            <br>
            If the boundary shrinks whilst you are out of it, you must use transit to get inside the boundary at the next available opportunity.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            To use transit, the runners must also spend "credits". Credits are earned through drawing cards, found on this
            website. If a card is drawn, what it says must be announced to all other players, and you must either complete what it says
            or forfeit the card. If the card is completed, then you gain a number of credits equal to what is shown on the card. However, if the card is forfeited,
            you cannot use public transit or draw another card for 20 minutes. Each runner starts with 4 credits. Travel in the 15 minutes before the timer starts
            does <strong>not</strong> require credits. Do not cause a disturbance to the general-public when completing cards.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            When using the rail, you may not intentionally linger behind fare gates since it forces another player to pay money.
            When tapping into a fare gate, you must go to your destination: not stay on the tube to obfuscate the GPS.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            The number of credits to go on different modes of transit can be found below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Southeastern High Speed: 4 Credits</li>
            <li>Other National Rail: 3 Credits</li>
            <li>TfL Managed Trains/Thameslink Core/Northern City Line: 2 Credits</li>
            <li>Bus/Coach/Tram/Taxi/Boat: 1 Credit</li>
            <li>Santander Cycle/IFS Cloud Car: 0 Credits</li>
          </ul>
          <i style="color: slategray;">*TfL Managed Trains include: London Underground, London Overground, the DLR and the Elizabeth Line</i>

            Rules of Fare Play
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            To make the game fair and not get any participants into trouble, some special rules apply to <strong>both runners and hunters:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>- Members of the public should not be disturbed whilst people are playing the game. Don't barge through crowds or intentionally cause a ruckus.</li>
            <li>- When you board any TfL-managed service (i.e. go through or tap into a fare gate), you must go as direct to your destination as possible. This is to lower the time that the GPS does not work.</li>
            <li>- Do not run indoors, underground, near train tracks or on public transport.</li>
            <li>- Do not enter areas (except public transport) which requires you to pay for entry. This is to stop price gauging other players.</li>
            <li>- When using ferries, you may only complete journeys with a total time of 20 minutes or less.</li>
          </ul>
